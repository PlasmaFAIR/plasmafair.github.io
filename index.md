## Supporting Plasma Software in the UK

PlasmaFAIR is a new community network of RSEs working in plasma
science. Our goal is to improve the quality and sustainability of
plasma research software.

[_Software Sustainability_](https://software.ac.uk/resources/approaches-software-sustainability)
:  _That the software you use today will be available - and continue to be
   improved and supported - in the future._

We offer a free [health-check](#how-it-works) of your software,
including development effort to implement some of our sustainability
and usability recommendations, to ensure that your software can
continue to be used for research well into the future. Typically, we
offer one-to-two weeks of effort, and don't offer to implement major
features.

### Software is Important

The [majority of UK research relies on
software](https://software.ac.uk/resources/approaches-software-sustainability),
and this is especially true in plasma science. From first principles
simulations of gyrokinetics, to data analysis of solar observations,
via reaction networks of atmospheric plasmas, we all use research
software. It's vital then that this software is reliable, trustworthy,
and sustainable.

Software is often overlooked as a research output, but just as
publishing a paper can have unexpected impacts in other fields,
releasing software can also have impacts in unanticipated places. For
example, [BOUT++](http://boutproject.github.io) was originally written
for fusion plasmas in tokamaks, but has since been used for a whole
host of other applications from space plasmas to chocolate
bubbles. Those impacts might never have happened if BOUT++ was closed
and inaccessible to other researchers.

### Data is Important

Many plasma simulations make use of supercomputers, sometimes using
more than ten thousand CPU-hours per run. The data generated from such
simulations is expensive -- not just in economic cost, but [also in
terms of CO2](https://chryswoods.github.io/howmuchisenough/) -- and is
currently only often used once. Publishing our simulation data would
allow other researchers to build upon our work, getting secondary use
out of our expensively generated datasets.

### The FAIR principles

We at PlasmaFAIR think that both software and data deserves to be FAIR:

- **F**indable: we should be able to search for them using keywords
- **A**ccessible: we should be able to get hold of the code/data, even
  if it means authentication and authorisation
- **I**nteroperable: data should be stored in common, machine-readable
  file formats, and software should write to such files
- **R**eusable: both software and data should be licensed to allow
  other researchers to build on top of them

You can find out more about the FAIR principles for data at [Go
FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)[^1]

## What Are We Doing About It

We think making software and data FAIR is so important that we want to
help you improve the FAIRness of your project, whether it's big or
small, ancient Fortran or bleeding-edge Julia, student code or massive
team; get in touch and find out how we can help!

### How it works {#how-it-works}

0. Fill in an [application form]({{ page.hero_link }})!
1. An RSE from PlasmaFAIR will have an initial
   [health-check](./healthcheck.html) discussion with you about your
   software. This is a pretty informal chat, covering various aspects
   of both your software and the wider project. We'll talk about
   things like version control, testing, and documentation.
2. From the initial discussion, the RSE will draw up a list of
   recommendations on how to improve the sustainability and usability
   of your software.
3. Out of this list of recommendations, you and the RSE will decide on
   some to do as part of the PlasmaFAIR project. We typically expect
   this project to take one to two weeks, but longer or shorter
   projects are possible.
4. After finishing the project, the RSE will write up a short report
   describing the software and the improvements we made. We'd like to
   make the reports publicly available, and add your software to our
   directory of plasma research software.


### Get Involved

Do you write research software in plasma science? Join PlasmaFAIR and
help us improve the plasma software ecosystem, or complete
health-checks for your own software and tell us about it (coming
soon).
